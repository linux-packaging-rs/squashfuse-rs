# squashfuse-rs

Implementation of FUSE for SquashFS in rust using the [fuser](https://docs.rs/fuser/latest/fuser/index.html) and [squashfs_ng](https://docs.rs/squashfs-ng/latest/squashfs_ng/index.html) crates!

Inspired by <https://github.com/vasi/squashfuse/tree/master>

PRs are welcome, I don't claim to know a lot about SquashFS and FUSE, so if there is a better way of doing things, please let me know!
